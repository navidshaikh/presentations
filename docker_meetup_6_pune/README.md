## Talk Synopsis:
Tihe Atomic Developer bundle (ADB) is a development environment for
containers from the same people that are bringing you the Atomic
Host. The ADB is growing to help you create containers for use with
Docker, orchestrators like Kubernetes, PaaS platforms like OpenShift
and Mesos. In this presentation, Navid and Brian will demonstrate how
the ADB works with host-based tools and IDEs on Linux, Windows, and Mac
OS X and how you can kickstart development on Kubernetes, OpenShift,
etc on a preconfigured Vagrant box. The talk will cover the capabilities
provided by the Atomic Developer Bundle and ecosystem of client side tools
that can leverage the capabilities and provide smooth user experience
for containerized development. Learn how to use it, how we built it,
and how you can make it better.
